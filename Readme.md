# Waker 2

## Visual Alarm

Since the concept of knowing how to tell time is not something we are born with, grasping that concept at a very young age can be crucial to the sleeping well being of both parents and children. The Waker app was designed out of our family's necessity to minimize the time between when our child woke up in the morning and when they knew it was ok for them to leave their bedroom.

This application currently has three different pre-alarm modes
  + Color Bars Indicator
  + Color Circle Indicator
  + Math Equations Indicator

By using the concept of colors set to change in a timed sequence, children are able to recognize and predict the next set of colors, through repetition. Waker's unique Pre-Alarm Timer gives the child the opportunity to anticipate the next sequence of colors, that ultimately leads to the simple, yet affective, Wake Up screen.

For the more advance preschool aged child, there is the Math Equations Indicator that is build to help give the child some simple single-digit math equations with a fun High Score that resets everyday. The daily reset gives the child a daily opportunity to achieve a small victory every day!

The Waker app can also be used as a quick timer for short activities such as:

  + Getting dressed
  + Play time
  + Bath time
  + Eating sessions
  + Homework
  + Brushing teeth
  + and many more!

*** FEATURES ***

  + Simple and quick setup
  + On-screen clock
  + Heavy Rain noise generator
  + Confetti when a High Score is achieved in the Math mode 
  + Bright green Wake Up screen
  + Pre-Alarm Indicator selection


It is recommended that the device is plugged into a charging solution while the app is in use for overnight sessions or for long term use.
